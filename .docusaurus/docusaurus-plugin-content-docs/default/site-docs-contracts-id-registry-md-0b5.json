  "description": "The Id Registry contract is used to keep track of Farcaster IDs. It maps an fid to an owning Ethereum address. The owner can also designate a \"recovery address\" which can be used to recover the fid if the owner loses access to the registering address. Registering an fid for the first time must be done through the ID Gateway.",
