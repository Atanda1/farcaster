# Contracts

Farcaster contracts are deployed on Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 network. There are three core contracts: Id Registry, Key Registry, and Storage Registry. Write access to the ID and Key registry is gated through the Gateway contracts. There is also a Bundler helper contract to make it easy to register an fid, add a key and rent storage in one transaction.
